# Regular searches

Regular searches use opt-out Search Providers. Each time you perform a search, Quick Search uses all regular Search Providers, and returns their combined results. You can [exclude specific providers](#excluding-search-providers) to obtain more precise results.

Items that best match the search query appear higher in the results. Quick search also learns over time, and prioritizes items that you select often. See [Settings](settings.md) to learn how to customize search result ordering.

> [!NOTE]
> Quick search also has special opt-in Search Providers that are not used in regular searches. See [Special searches](special-searches.md) for details

## Excluding Search Providers
You can exclude specific Search Providers from a regular search. To exclude a provider, do one of the following:

- [Mute a provider from the Filters pane](search-filters.md#persistent-search-filters). When you mute a provider, Quick Search does not use it in searches, but its background activities (such as indexing parts of Unity) continue to run.
- [Disable a provider from the preferences](settings.md). When you disable a provider, Quick Search does not use it at all, and stops all of its background activities.
