# Special searches

Special searches use opt-in Search Providers that Quick Search ignores unless you explicitly use them. Special searches differ from [regular searches](regular-searches.md) in the following ways:

- You can only execute a special search using its search token.
- You cannot combine a special search with any other Search Provider.
- You cannot toggle a special Search Provider on and off in the [Filters pane](searc-filters.md#persistent-search-filters). However, you can disable Special Searches from the [Quick Search Preferences](settings.md).  

To perform a special search, prefix your search query with the provider's _search token_.

Quick search has the following special Search Providers:
